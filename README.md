# Street Vendor Finder

## Project Description
Street Vendor Finder is a web application that helps users locate nearby street vendors and see what they are selling. Many people walk around the city without knowing where food vendors are located or what food is available. This app will allow vendors to register, post their location, and show their menu, while users can easily find vendors near them.

The goal of the project is to create a responsive full-stack web application that solves a real-world problem for both vendors and customers.

## Major Features

### 1. Vendor Registration and Dashboard
Vendors can create an account and add their business information, including name, food type, location, hours, and menu.

### 2. Vendor Search and Listing
Users can browse or search for street vendors based on location or food type and view their details.

### 3. Responsive Web Interface
The application will be fully responsive so it works on phones, tablets, and desktops, making it easy to use while walking around the city.
